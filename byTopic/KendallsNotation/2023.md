**In a single server system, arrivals can be modelled as a Poisson process with rate of 3min-1 and the service times are exponentially distributed with mean 8 s. \

Calculate the average delay and the average waiting time.\
Calculate the average number of customers in the queue.**

Arrivals: 3 customers per minute.\
0.05 customers per second (λ).\
Service takes 8s to service one customer.\
μ=average number of customers that can be served per unit time.\
Therefore, in 1 second you can serve 0.125 customers. (μ)

Traffic Intensity  = customers per second / service rate\
Traffic = 0.05/0.125 = 0.4 (p)

Average number of customers in the system = 0.4 / (1-0.4)\
= 0.66667 (p / (1-p)) aka L

Average delay (time spent in the system) = 0.66667/0.05 = 13.33334\
1/(0.125-0.05) \
Little's Law: (L / λ) or (1/(μ-λ))

Average number of customers in the queue = 0.42 / (1-0.4)\
= 0.26667

Average waiting time (time spent in the queue) = 0.26667 / 0.05\
Number of customers in the queue / λ\
= 5.33334

Representing this in Kendall's notation\
a:  The type of arrival process the queuing system uses\
b: The service time distribution\
m: The number of servers\
K: The number of customers allowed in the queuing process

a:  M – Markov, the arrival of customers can be modelled exponentially\
b: M – Markov, time is takes to serve a customer follows an exponential distribution\
m: 1 – it is explicitly told that this is a single-server system\
K: Irrelevant, there is no limits to the queue

**Calls arrive to a call-centre according to a Poisson process with intensity of 2 calls per minute. \
The call holding times are exponentially distributed with an average of 12 s. \
Calls that find all operators busy are blocked. \
Note: Show your workings when answering the questions below.\
Describe this system using Kendall notation, motivating your choice.\
How many operators are necessary to keep the blocking probability below 0.01?**

Kendall's notation:\
a: M, the arrival process is modelled in a Poisson distribution with a rate parameter of  λ=1/30 per second. This can be modelled as a Markov chain and is therefore a Markovian arrival system.\
b: M, the service time distribution is modelled exponentially. Service time is not dependent on any previous services times and is memoryless. This can also be modelled by a Markov chain.\
m: c, there is a limited number of servers available, indicated that there is some number of operators "c" which can become full\
K: c, this system turns away any calls which cannot reach an operator, therefore the number of customers allowed into the system is equal to the number of operators

Kendall's notation: M/M/c/c

The Markov chain:

Intensity of 2 calls per minute. \
1/30 of a call every second. = λ

Service time distribution is exponential. 12 seconds to service a call.\
1/12 calls are serviced in a second = μ

There are c servers and no queue, any arrival while all operators are busy is blocked.\
The intensity of traffic is (1/30)/(1/12) = 2/5 = 0.4\
If there were infinite operators, we'd expect 0.4 calls to be serviced at any given time.\
We need to find the probability that all call operators are full.\
State	Meaning	Arrivals	Service Rate

0:	No operators are busy	1/30 (λ)	0 (no service in progress)\
1:	1 operator is busy	1/30 (λ)	μ (service rate)\
2:	2 operators are busy	1/30 (λ)	2μ (service rate for 2 operators)\
...
c:	C operators are busy	1/30 (λ)	cμ (service rate for all operators)\



The denominator will accumulate as we have to increase c

P1 = 0.41/1! / (0.40/0! + 0.41/1!) = 0.285714 is the blocking rate, the chance that 1 operator is busy.

P2 = 0.42/2! / (0.40/0! + 0.41/1! + 0.42/2!) = 0.054 is the blocking rate, the chance that 2 operators are busy

P3 = 0.43/3! / (0.40/0! + 0.41/1! + 0.42/2! + 0.43/3!) = 0.0072 is the blocking rate, the chance that 3 operators are busy, this is less than the 0.01 desired
