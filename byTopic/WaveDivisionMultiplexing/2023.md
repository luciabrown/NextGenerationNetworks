Q.6 
**A Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) transmission system uses 20 channels in the C band and needs to operate over a 400 km distance.<br> Amplifiers have 18 dBm of power and noise figure of 8 dB, while the fibre has a nominal attenuation of 0.3 dB/km. <br> The amplifier gain can be set to between 10 and 20 dB. Also consider that a margin of at least 5 dB is required. <br>**

Given:<br> 
	• 20 channels<br> 
	• 400km total distance<br> 
	• 18dBm amplifier power<br> 
	• 8dB amplifier noise figure<br> 
	• 0.3dB/km fibre loss<br> 
	• 10-20dB amplifier gain range<br> 
	• 5dB required margin<br> 
	• 50Gbaud baudrate<br> 

**a) Assuming you need to support an overall capacity of at least 5.8 Tb/s, what is the maximum amplifier distance for the system to work without regenerators? (you can approximate to the closest smallest 5km multiple). <br> Consider that the transceivers have a baud rate of 50 Gbaud and can work at modulation formats of 16QAM, 32 QAM and 64 QAM, which require, respectively, 18, 23 and 28 dB OSNR.<br>**

Loss in each span = 0.3*SpanLength<br> 
Loss including margin = 5 + 0.3 * S<br> 
Gain (10dB-20dB) must satisfy 5 + 0.3 * S<br> 

The minimum value that satisfies this is S=17 span length<br> 
400/17 = 23.5294 ~ 24 spans/amplifiers<br> 
Gain = 10.1dB<br> 

The maximum value that satisfies this is S=50 span length<br> 
400/50 = 8 spans/amplifiers<br> 
Gain = 20dB<br> 

50km is the maximum allows span length, this would use 8 amplifiers.<br> 
OSNR = PowerTotal - NF - G - 10log10(numberChannels) - 10log10(numberAmplifiers) + 58 - M<br> 
OSNR = 18 - 8 - 20 - 10log10(20) - 10log10(8) + 58 = 25.95 ~ 26dB<br> 
16QAM	= 18<br> 
32QAM	= 23<br> 
64QAM	= 28<br> 

64 QAM cannot be used.<br> 
16QAM or 32QAM can be used.<br> 

32QAM encodes 5 bits per symbol<br> 
Channel baud rate = 50Gbaud<br> 

50Gbaud*5 = 250Gbaud per channel<br> 

250Gbaud * 20 channels = 5000Gbps.<br> 
This is 5Tbps and does not support the required  5.8 Tb/s.<br> 

By using the minimum allowable gain = 10dB, using a span length of 17km and 24 amplifiers:<br> 
OSNR = 18 - 8 - 10 - 10log10(20) - 10log10(24) + 58 = 57.2dB<br> 
This allows the system to use 64QAM modulation which allows encoding of 6 bits per signal.<br> 
50Gbaud*6 = 300Gbaud per channel<br> 
300Gbaud per channel * 20 channels = 6000Gbps<br> 
This is 6Tbps and supports the required  5.8 Tb/s.<br> 

**b) The system uses coherent transmission, so no dispersion compensating fibre (DCF) is required. <br> The transceiver can work at a baud rate of either 33Gbaud (37.5 GHz bandwidth) or 66 Gbaud (75GHz bandwidth). <br> The maximum tolerable dispersion by the digital filter is however 1ns. <br> What is the total capacity you can achieve over the 20 channels if the available OSNR is > 28dB (assuming the modulation formats as defined in the previous problem)? Assume the average dispersion coefficient of the fibre to be 5 ps/nm/km (assume the following conversion ratio: 100 GHz = 0.8 nm). <br>**


OPTIONS:<br> 
	33Gbaud & 37.5 GHz bandwidth or 66Gbaud & 75GHz bandiwdth.<br> 
TOLERABLE DISPERSION:<br> 
	1ns<br> 
AVERAGE DISPERSION:<br> 
	5ps/nm/km<br> 
OSNR:<br> 
	>  28dB (16QAM, 32 QAM and 64 QAM can all be used here potentially)<br> 
DISTANCE THE SYSTEM HAS TO TRAVEL:<br> 
	400km<br> 
	
What is the total capacity you can achieve over the 20 channels?<br> 
100GHz = 0.8nm<br> 
1GHZ = 0.008nm<br> 
37.5GHz = 0.008 * 37.5=0.3nm<br> 
75GHz = 0.008*75 = 0.6nm<br> 

Overall dispersion in the entire system = 400km*5ps/nm/km = 2000ps/nm<br> 

Try 33GBaud:<br> 
2000ps/nm * 0.3nm = 600ps<br> 

Try 66GBaud:<br> 
2000ps/nm * 0.6nm = 1200ps<br> 

The allowable dispersion is 1000ps. Only 33Gbaud stays within this limit<br> 

Calculate the capacity<br> 
OSNR allows 64-QAM to be used - encoding 6 bits per symbol.<br> 
33Gbaud * 6 = 198Gb/s (per channel)<br> 

198Gb/s * 20 channels = 3960 Gb/s (overall capacity)<br> 

Total system capacity using a coherent system which can compensate for dispersion digitally instead of using DCF is 
3.96Tb/s
