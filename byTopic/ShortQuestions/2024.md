**Which one among the following characteristics does not refer to path loss?**\
**a) The signal attenuates with distance**\
**b) It can also happen in Line of Sight (LoS) conditions**\
**c) It models the attenuation from obstacles**\
**d) The signal power attenuation is proportional to  1/d^2 , where d is the distance between transmitter and receiver**

Ans - C: path loss does NOT model the attenuation from obstacles

**Which one among the following statements does not relate to a millimetre Wave (mmWave) communication system?**\
**a) It can provide high link data rates**\
**b) It can easily support mobility**\
**c) It can leverage insights from WiGig standard**\
**d) It needs to use highly directional antennas**

Ans - B: mmWave design CANNOT easily support mobility\
mmWave has a huge bandwidth do it has the capacity to provide high link data rates\
It can leverage insights from WiGig standard (60GHz)\
mmWave signals weaken very quickly so highly directional antennas can be used to mitigate this\
mmWave experiences difficulty in mobility because beams must constantly track the user and signals are easily blocked

**Which one among the statements about Cellular Automata (CA) is correct?**\
**a) The state value of cell n at time t+1 only depends on the state value of cell n at time t**\
**b) The state value of cell n at time t+1 only depends on the state value of the neighbouring cells at time t**\
**c) The state value of cell n at time t only depends on the state value of the neighbouring cells at time t**\
**d) The state value of cell n at time t+1 only depends on the state value of cell n at time t and on the state value of the neighbouring cells at time t**

Ans - D: the state value of cell n at time t+1 only depends on the state value of the cell n at time t and on the state value of the neighbouring cells at time t.\
The cell in the cellular automata must also pay attention to its own current state value before changing its state value depending on its neighbours.\
The cell may not require a change based on its neighbours if it is already in the correct state

**Which one among the statements about a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is incorrect?\
a) It consists of a planar surface with a small amount of reconfigurable elements\
b) It can adjust the propagation of incident signal via phase changes\
c) It can adjust the propagation of incident signal via amplitude changes\
d) It consumes little energy**

Ans - A: Reconfigurable Intelligence Surface does NOT consist of a planar surface with a small amount of reconfigurable elements.\
RIS is a large surface which consists of a very large number of tiny reconfigurable elements

**Why is wavelength dependent gain in optical amplifiers a problem for optical transmission networks?\
a) Because it reduces the number of channels that can be used in an amplified WDM system\
b) Because it causes additional polarisation mode dispersion to some of the channels\
c) Because it causes additional chromatic dispersion to some of the channels\
d) Because it leads to different channels being amplified differently and thus having different OSNR.**

Ans - D: Because it leads to different channels being amplified differently and thus having different OSNR

**Given several equal instances of the following quantum state |ψ ≥ √2/5|0 > +√3/5|1 >. \
What probabilities can you infer if you measure the multiple instances of that state?\
a) There is not sufficient information to determine the probability of getting a 0 or a 1.\
b) The probability of getting 0 is 40% and the probability of getting 1 is 60%\
c) The probability of getting 0 is 20% and the probability of getting 1 is 30%\
d) The probability of getting 0 is 50% and the probability of getting 1 is 50%**

Ans - B: the probability of getting 0 is 40% and the probability of getting 1 is 60%.\
Make sure to pay attention to where the √ symbol is. When it is on the bottom, it is indicating an entanglement.\
When you measure a qubit, you take the square of the amplitude (√2/5)^2=  2/5  & (√3/5)^2=  3/5


**Given several equal instances of the following the following quantum state:\
|Ψ+ ≥ (|01>+|10>)/√2  . What happens if you measure the first qubit and the results is 1?\
a) The second qubit has 50% probability of being 0 and 50% probability of being 1\
b) The second qubit has 100% probability of being 1\
c) The second qubit has 100% probability of being 0\
d) It is not possible to estimate the probability of the outcome following a measurement of the second qubit**

Ans - C: the second qubit has a 100% probability of being 0\
This is due to entanglement of the qubits. Once the state of the first qubit is revealed, then the state of the second qubit must be known.


**Which one among the following statements about entangled qubits is false?\
a) Since entanglement works instantly at any distance, it can be used to transmit information faster than the speed of light\
b) Entanglement can be used to teleport the information of one qubit at any distance\
c) Entanglement can be produced in a quantum circuit using a Hadamard gate followed by a CNOT gate\
d) Bell states are maximally entangled states**

Ans - A: since entanglement works instantly at any distance, it does not mean that it can be used to transmit information faster than the speed of light. Quantum entangled qubits still must obey the laws of physics.
